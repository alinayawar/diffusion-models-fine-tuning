# Hugging Face Diffusion Models


- 👩‍🎓 Study the theory behind diffusion models
- 🧨 Learn how to generate images and audio with the popular 🤗 Diffusers library
- 🏋️‍♂️ Train your own diffusion models from scratch
- 📻 Fine-tune existing diffusion models on new datasets
- 🗺 Explore conditional generation and guidance
- 🧑‍🔬 Create your own custom diffusion model pipelines


## Sections
| 📘 Unit           | 👩‍💻 Hands-on |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [An Introduction to Diffusion Models] - Part1 | Introduction to Diffusers and Diffusion Models From Scratch |
| [Fine-Tuning and Guidance] - Part2 | Fine-Tuning a Diffusion Model on New Data and Adding Guidance |
| [Stable Diffusion] - Part3 | Exploring a Powerful Text-Conditioned Latent Diffusion Model |
| [Doing More with Diffusion] - Part4 | Advanced Techniques to Take Diffusion Further |


This consist of at least **4 Parts.** More will be added as time goes on, on topics like diffusion for audio. 

Each unit consists of some theory and background alongside one or more hands-on notebooks. Some units will also contain suggested projects and we'll have competitions and swag for the best pipelines and demos (more details TDB).
